# Spec questions

Log of ambiguities hit while implementing `docs/build-plan.md`. Per build-plan
rule 0.2 / rule 2: never invent schema, endpoints, ID formats, or grammar
beyond `docs/mvp-spec.md`. When something is ambiguous, implement the
narrowest reading, add a `# SPEC-QUESTION:` comment at the site, and log an
entry here so a human can resolve it.

Entry format:

```
## <task ID> — <one-line question>
- **Where:** <file:line>
- **Narrowest reading taken:** <what was implemented in the meantime>
- **Resolution:** <filled in once a human answers; leave "open" until then>
```

This file holds **open** questions only. Resolved entries are moved to
`docs/archived-questions.md` in a batch when the milestone that raised them
closes (context-size optimization — an agent scanning for outstanding
ambiguities shouldn't have to read past closed ones). See that file for the
full resolved history: M1 (T1.3/T1.5/T1.6/T1.7), M3 (T3.1/T3.2/T3.5/T3.6×2),
M4 (13 entries, 2026-07-12), and M5 (10 entries: T5.1/T5.5/T5.8-*, 2026-07-13).

**No open questions at present** (all M5 questions resolved and archived at
M5 close, 2026-07-13). Next work: M6 (Obsidian plugin).
