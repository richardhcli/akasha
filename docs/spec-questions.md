# Spec questions

Log of ambiguities hit while implementing `docs/build-plan.md`. Per build-plan
rule 0.2 / rule 2: never invent schema, endpoints, ID formats, or grammar
beyond `docs/mvp-spec.md`. When something is ambiguous, implement the
narrowest reading, add a `# SPEC-QUESTION:` comment at the site, and log an
entry here so a human can resolve it.

Entry format:

```
## <task ID> — <one-line question>
- **Where:** <file:line>
- **Narrowest reading taken:** <what was implemented in the meantime>
- **Resolution:** <filled in once a human answers; leave "open" until then>
```
